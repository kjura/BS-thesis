# Python Machine learning checklist

From chapter 2: "Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification" I should be able to:
- Implement perceptron model in Python from scratch 
- Implement ADALINE model from scratch
- Explain what is a gradient descent method and use calculus to obtain the partial derivative of the SSE cost function with respect to the jth weight.
- Explain what is a feature scalling and implement it to ADALINE model so it can converge at a faster rate
- Explain the difference between batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, online learning and mini-batch gradient descent.
- ... MORE WILL COME IF I RECALL ANY DIFFICULTIES FROM CHAPTER 2
